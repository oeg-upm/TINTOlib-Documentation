However, it is widely known that not all of these algorithms are adapted to efficient solutions in certain tidy data format datasets. For this reason, novel techniques are currently being developed to convert tidy data into images with the aim of using vision models such as CNN or Vision Transformers (ViTs). TINTOlib offers the opportunity to convert tidy data into images through several techniques: TINTO, IGTD, REFINED, SuperTML, BarGraph, DistanceMatrix, Combination, FeatureWrap and BIE.\n","\n","In this tutorial, we develop a Hybrid Neural Network with synthetic images, which combines a CNN and a MLP.\n","\n","<figure><center>\n","  <img src=\"../../Images/HyNN.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Gráfica\">\n","  <figcaption><blockquote>Hybrid Neural Network (MLP+CNN) architecture.</a></blockquote></figcaption>\n","</center></figure>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HFrF4C89jpCt"},"source":["---\n","<a id=\"section11\"></a>\n","# <font color=\"#004D7F\" size=5> 1.1.
